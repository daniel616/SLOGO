#Any information about using the program

Try "spiral.logo" to see recursion work! Load the TryFlower.xml to the library and then type in "tell [ 1 2 4 6 ] flower id" to watch multiple turtles draw their own flower according to the size of their ids! Press the Hide/Show button on the gui to remove the text boxes and press it again to bring them back. Groups work in the back end with Turtle, Boolean, and Math commands. The buttons and text items in the gui all change language upon switching the language and setting the language. Listeners are implemented so that front end components are modified by editing data structures in the back end.
